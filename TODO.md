# JJ-Nvim Feature Roadmap

## High Priority Features

### Bugs

- Pushing to remote. message is duplicated and one of them never dismisses
- Improve detection of immutable commit updates; we need a system that checks the output of jj commands and responds in certain cases like immutable commit errors and allow new errors when pushing. All command flows should hook into this check and display proper prompts to allow the user to seamlessly adjust and rerun the command on the fly
- Rebase uses custom bookmark menu for choosing target commit instead of using log window selection method
- Rebasing uses a bookmark menu that shows every bookmark including remotes; this should only show local bookmarks since rebasing onto a tracked bookmark makes no sense

### Misc

- remove 'v' duplicate command; it isn't needed
- change V keybind to something else

### File-Level Diff Navigation

- Navigate between changed files within a diff view
- Jump to specific files from diff summary
- File tree view for commits with many changes
- Quick file filtering and search within diffs

### Search & Filter Capabilities

- Search commits by message, author, or date range
- Filter by branch, bookmark, or tag
- Quick search with fuzzy matching
- Saved search patterns and filters
